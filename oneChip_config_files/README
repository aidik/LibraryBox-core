This folder contains configuration files and scripts, that are used 
in the context of these tiny one chip computers.

The following one Chip computers are known to be supported by these scripts:

	- RaspberryPi

The scripts are based to run on Arch linux.



The network configuration is per default:

	bridge 
 	+ (contains)
	+-------> wifi with hostapd   	on wlan0
	+
	+-------> ethernet Port		on eth0

Bridge is running with the following IP:

	192.168.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.0

	IPv6 is currently not enabled

During the Startup of the PirateBox Scripts, the Wifi(-USB)-Adapter is added to 
the bridge, after the hostapd brought it up.

So, even with directly connection to via LAN cable to the computer, the Box is accessible via 192.168.1.1 (use ssh).



The configuration can be changed, that the box will request an IP via dhcp on ethernet, when running the following commands as root:

# Enable it now:
	netctl switch-to lan_dhcp


# For enabling the ethernet port as a normal client during bootup, run:
	netctl disalbe lan_piratebox_bridge
	netctl enable  lan_dhcp
